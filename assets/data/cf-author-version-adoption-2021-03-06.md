## Methodology
This data was calculated by looking at the total number of pages available for each major game version. CurseForge displays up to 20 mods per page allowing for the general total to be calculated easily. Because the last page can show less than 20 mods there is a maximum error potential of 19 mods per version, or 0.09%. Some entries such as Any, 1.2.x, 1.1.x, and 1.0.x calculated the last page by hand to provide an exact count with no error potential.

This data includes all sub versions within the same major version. For example 1.16.3 and 1.16.5 are both counted as 1.16.x. This choice was made to simplify the data collection and presentation. While one may expect this to bias versions which patched more frequently the data does not strongly reflect this. For instance 1.7 recieved the most patches, while 1.12 recieved much less.

The percentages listed show the % out of the Any (total) count. These percentages do not add up to 100% because mods can support multiple versions of the game. This only looks at supported versions, not the version period that the project was initially released under.

## Conclusions
This data should not be used to pressure developers into supporting a specific version. This is purely a snapshot displaying how each version has been adopted by mod developers so far. This is purely for fun and speculation.
