## Methodology
This data was calculated by looking at the total number of pages available for the given version of the game. CurseForge displays up to 20 mods per page allowing the total to be approximated easily. Because the last page can display less than 20 mods there is a margin of error of 19 mods or 0.4%. Some entries such as All and 1.0.x have been hand calculated to remove this margin of error.

This data includes all sub versions within the same major version unless otherwise stated. For example 1.16.3 and 1.16.5 are both included in 1.16.5. Versions of interest such as 1.12.2 have also been listed seperately. This choice was made to simplify the collection and presentation of the data. While one may expect this to bias versions that are patched more the data does not reflect this.

The percentages shown are the % out of the All count. These percentages do not add up to 100% because mods can support multiple versions of the game. This only looks at supported versions, not the version period that the project was initially released under.

## Conclusions
This data should not be used to pressure developers into supporting a specific version. This is purely a snapshot displaying how each version has been adopted by mod developers so far. This is purely for fun and speculation.
